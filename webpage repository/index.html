      <h3>Abbib Akram</h3>
      <p>My love for computer science first started when I chose computer science for my GCSE.I was first introduced to concepts such as algorithmic thinking and procedural programming which lead me to follow my aspirations and undertake an A-level in Computer science,Psychology and Economics.During my A-levels I expanded my knowledge on topics such as software development methadologies and types of programming languages.This lead me to create my first ever project.My project involved detecting if someone was wearing a face mask or not.Although this project was challenging ,it taught me a lot about data analyis,probability and machine learning.<p>

      <p>After completing this project I decided to pursue the aspects of computer science which relate to mathematics,data anlysis,data science and machine learning.This led me to embark on a BSC computer science degree at City university where I am currently studying modules which will enhance my skills in software development and data analysis.</p> 

      <p>After completeing my bachelors degree I plan to go into data analytics which will be a pre-cursor to the a masters degree in data science,computer science or financial mathematics.After this I might progress onto PHD level study or build a careers in quantitative analytics.<p>

    <h3>Java project semester 2: Avoid the cannon fire</h3>
    <p>
	My project is a platform game which is based on games where you have to avoid hitting the projectile to survive and progress on to the next level(It involves soldiers,platforms and cannons),with each level getting harder as the artillery fire become more intense.If the projectile hits the soldier,the soldier will diappear as it dies and the game will end.My game consists of three levels,worlds which are visually stimulating and a range of sounds.
  <p>
    This project has been very insightful as I have learnt a lot about object-oriented programming,object interaction and GUI interaction.
